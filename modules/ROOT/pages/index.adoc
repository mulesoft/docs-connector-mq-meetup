Anypoint MQ is a multi-tenant, cloud messaging service that enables customers to perform advanced asynchronous messaging scenarios between their applications. Anypoint MQ is fully integrated with Anypoint Platform, offering role based access control, client application management, and connectors.

*See:* xref:mq-connectors.adoc[Anypoint MQ Connectors], xref:mq-faq.adoc[Anypoint MQ FAQ] and
xref:release-notes::mq/anypoint-mq-release-notes.adoc[Anypoint MQ Release Notes].

*Note:* Anypoint MQ does not support use with CloudHub Insight or Anypoint Monitoring. Instead you can use the xref:mq-usage.adoc[MQ usage graphs] to view consumed data and API requests and how many message units were received, or you can use the xref:mq-apis.adoc#mqstatapi[MQ Stats API] to perform statistical analysis of queue performance.

== Anypoint MQ Workflow

The steps that follow help you use Anypoint MQ. This same workflow is described in the xref:mq-tutorial.adoc[Anypoint MQ Tutorial].

Install and configure Anypoint MQ:

. Log into Anypoint Platform using your Enterprise Mule credentials, and click *MQ*.
. Click *Access Management*, then *Users* or *Roles* to create an Anypoint MQ user or role.
. From MQ, create a xref:mq-queues.adoc[queue], xref:mq-exchanges.adoc[message exchange], or a xref:mq-queues.adoc#fifoqueues[FIFO queue].
. Click a queue or message exchange name in the detail to access the Message Sender to send messages to a queue or message exchange, and to use the Message Browser to get messages from a queue.
. From MQ, click Client Apps to register an application. You can view the client ID and client secret for the application.

In Anypoint Studio:

. Install the Anypoint MQ connector using Anypoint Exchange.
. Create a new Mule project with needed building blocks, such as an HTTP connector, Anypoint MQ connector, Set Payload, and a Logger.
. Configure the Anypoint MQ connector and provide the Client ID and Secret of the application.
. Set the Anypoint MQ connector's *Operation* to publish or consume messages, or to manually ack (accept a message) or nack (don't accept a message). Alternatively to ack or nack, Anypoint MQ can provide xref:mq-ack-mode.adoc[automatic Acknowledgment Mode]. If you set the Operation to publish, set the Destination to the name of a queue or message exchange that you created in Anypoint Platform. If you sent the Operation to consume, specify the name of a queue from which you want to receive messages.
. Run the Mule application.

Test:

. Use a REST client such as curl or Postman to send or receive a message.
+
The Anypoint MQ application sends the string as a message to the queue or message exchange you specified.
+
. View your message in a browser or the Studio console.
