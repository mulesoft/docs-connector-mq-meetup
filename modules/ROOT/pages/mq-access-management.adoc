Anypoint Platform lets you manage the xref:access-management::managing-permissions.adoc[roles] of those who administer the Anypoint MQ features in Anypoint Platform for your organization.

== Create an Environment

Before you can give yourself Anypoint MQ access permissions, you need an environment to associate permissions with.

. Log into Anypoint Platform.
. Click *Access Management* from the left navigation bar or click *Access Management* from the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Environments* under *ACCESS MANAGEMENT*, and click *Add environment*:

+
. In the *Add Environment* screen, provide a name for your environment, and click either *Production* or *Sandbox*. You may want to create separate environments for each. A sandbox is used to test applications, whereas production is the public view. For this tutorial, you can choose *Production*.

== Give Users Anypoint MQ Access Permissions

First give yourself Anypoint MQ access permissions and then give others in your organization access.

Assign user permissions to yourself for use with Anypoint MQ. These permissions let you create client applications, and destinations by creating queues and exchanges. You can use the same information to assign user permissions for others in your organization.

To assign user permissions:

. In Anypoint Platform, click *Access Management and Users*.
. Click a user name value:
+

+
. Click *MQ* and set an environment and permissions. For permissions, you can click *Select all* to set all permissions, or *Select none* to erase previously clicked settings:
+

+
. Click the blue plus icon to save your settings:
+
image::mq-blue-plus-circle.png[]
+
A summary list appears:
+
image::mq-perms-display.png[]
+
You can use this display to delete permissions if needed.

== Create an Admin Role

You can create a role that you can apply to other users in your organization.
While you don't need roles to complete this tutorial, when you use Anypoint MQ as an administrator or developer, you should create
roles for all those in your organization who use MQ.

Creating a role lets you assign access rights to users in your organization, such as for administrators, developers, or for those who only view information but don't change it.

. In Anypoint Platform, click *Access Management* > *Roles*.
. Click *Add Role*.
+
image::mq-roles-add-role.png[]
+
. Name the role `Admin Role` and click the *Add role* button.
. Click the role name and click *MQ*.
. Specify the *Production* Environment, and set all the Permissions by clicking *Select All*:
+
image::mq-admin-role-detail.png[]
+
. Click the blue plus button to save your changes. Anypoint Platform displays your settings.

The settings are:

* *Clear destinations*: Same privileges as *View destinations*, plus permission to purge messages
* *Manage clients*: Same privileges as *View clients*, plus permission to create client apps
* *Manage destinations*: Same privileges as *View destinations* and *Clear destinations*, plus permission to:
    ** Create new queues and message exchanges
    ** Edit existing queues and message exchange settings
    ** Access *Message Sender* and *Browser* pages
    ** Delete messages
