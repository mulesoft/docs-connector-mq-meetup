An Anypoint MQ client application lets you register an application in Anypoint MQ. When registered, Anypoint MQ lists
the application's client ID and client secret which you need to configure the Anypoint MQ Connector in Anypoint Studio.

[NOTE]
An application does not have to exist for you to register it.

To register an application:

. In Anypoint Platform, click *MQ*.
. Click *Client Apps* from the left nav bar:
