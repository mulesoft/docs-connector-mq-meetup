A message exchange lets you send a message to one or more xref:mq-queues.adoc[queues] that are bound to the message exchange.

[NOTE]
====
* FIFO does not support the use of a message exchange. Similarly, FIFO queues cannot be bound to a message exchange.
* Message exchange names can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), dots (.), and dashes (-). All other characters are not allowed.
* Message exchange names are limited to 127 characters in length.
* The maximum size of a message sent to a message exchange is 10 MB.
====

Before creating a message exchange, create one or more queues. For more information, see xref:mq-queues.adoc#to-create-a-queue[Create a Queue].

To create a message exchange:

. Log into Anypoint Platform.
. Click *MQ* from the left navigation area or the Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the blue plus circle.
. Click *Exchange*.

[NOTE]
====
* Message exchange names can only contain these characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, period (.), and hyphen (-). Message exchange names cannot contain spaces or other characters.
* The message exchange name can be up to 127 characters in length.

== Send a Message to a Message Exchange

Sending a message to a message exchange is very similar to sending a message to a queue. The only difference is that you can get the message from any queue bound to a message exchange. The maximum message size sent to a message exchange is 10 MB.

To send a message to a message exchange:

. Log into Anypoint Platform.
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the `MessageExchange` entry in Destinations to view details about
the message exchange.
. Click the *MessageExchange* link in the details screen to access the Message Sender:
+

+
. Click *Message Sender*:
+
image::mq-exchange-msg-sender2.png[]
+
. Type the contents of the *Payload* and click *Send*:
+
image::mq-exchange-payload2.png[]

You can now use the Message Browser to get the message from MyDemoQueue as described
in xref:mq-queues.adoc#to-get-a-message-from-a-queue[Get a Message From a Queue].

You can also send comma-separated value (CSV) or JSON content in the payload by changing
the message *Type* value. For more information, see xref:mq-queues.adoc#to-send-a-csv-or-json-message[Send a CSV or JSON Message].
