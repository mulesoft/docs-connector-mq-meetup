= Tutorial: Create a Queue and Message Exchange
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

This tutorial helps you send and receive messages using Anypoint MQ using a 
publish/subscribe queue mechanism. Anypoint MQ provides a user interface built into
Anypoint Platform that lets you send messages to a queue or message exchange, 
and then read the messages from a queue. Anypoint MQ also provides a connector 
that works with Anypoint Studio. See xref:mq-connectors.adoc[Anypoint MQ Connectors] for 
information about Mule 3 and Mule 4 connectors that you can use with Anypoint Studio.

== Prerequisites

. Read xref:mq-understanding.adoc[Anypoint MQ Terminology].
. Create an Anypoint Platform account to configure an environment, user permissions, register applications in MQ, and to create queues and message exchanges. You can access Anypoint MQ in the Anypoint Platform and the left navigation bar.
. An Enterprise license is required to use MQ. Contact the MuleSoft Sales team to get a free trial.
. Download and install Anypoint Studio.
. You need a https://curl.haxx.se[`curl` command] to test Anypoint MQ in this tutorial. 

Queue and message exchange names can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), dots (.), and dashes (-). No other characters are allowed. Queue and message exchange names are limited to 127 characters in length.

== Create a Queue

A queue provides a temporary area for holding messages. Applications
push messages to the queue, and other applications consume
the messages. In Anypoint MQ, you can read messages, return the messages
for later viewing, or delete a message. By default, messages return to the
waiting area so that other applications can read them. Messages persist until the
time to live (TTL) value expires. By default, a message persists in Anypoint MQ
for up to 7 days. The minimum message TTL is 1 minute and the maximum is 14 days.

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*:
+
image::mq-destinations-option.png[]
+
. Click the blue plus icon image:mq-blue-plus-icon.png[]
. In the drop-down, click *Queue*:
+
image::mq-create-choices.png[]
+
image::mq-create-demo-queue.png[]
+
. In the *Create Queue* screen, specify a name for the queue. This tutorial uses `MyDemoQueue`. 
+
The TTL is the time to live, that is, how long a message can stay in a queue before being deleted. The default lock TTL determines how long a message is unavailable to other applications. A locked message does not block other messages from being read.
. When done, click *Save Changes*:
+
The queue creates and you are returned to the *Destinations* screen.
+
[NOTE]
====
Where you click on a queue entry in the Destinations screen governs what you see next:

image:mq-entryui.png[]
====

If you need to delete a queue, see xref:mq-faq.adoc#how-do-i-delete-a-queue[How do I delete a queue?] in the xref:mq-faq.adoc[Anypoint MQ FAQ].

== Send a Message to a Queue

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the `MyDemoQueue` entry in *Destinations* to view details about the queue.
. Click the left side of the queue entry to open the Messaging feature, or click the right side of the queue entry and click the arrow to the right of the queue name:
+
image::mq-access-messaging2.png[]
+
. In the settings page, click *Message Sender*:
+
image::mq-click-msg-sender2.png[]
+
. Type text in the Payload such as `Hello Mules` (leave the *Type* field set to *Text*):
+
image::mq-msg-sender-text-payload2.png[]
+
. Click *Send*.

== Verify the Message in a Queue

. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the right side of the queue entry to view details and see the number of messages in the queue:
+
image::mq-num-queued-msgs.png[]

== Get a Message From a Queue

. In *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ*, click *Message Browser*:
+
image::mq-click-msg-browser2.png[]
+
. Click Get Messages.
+
image::mq-get-messages2.png[]
+
. Click the message ID value to view the message.
+
image::mq-click-id2.png[]
+
. If you want to return the message to the queue, so other applications can read
the message, click the Return Messages icon - this is the default behavior. 
If you switch screens back to the Message Sender or to Destinations, messages 
automatically return to the queue. In Anypoint MQ, returning the messages to the 
queue is known as `nack` - the message is not altered. However, the time to 
live (TTL) value you set when you created your queue determines how long the 
message is available before Anypoint MQ deletes it.
+
image::mq-click-retmsgs2.png[]
+
Alternatively, you can delete the message by clicking the trash can icon. Anypoint MQ provides three modes for how messages delete after they are viewed. For more information, see xref:mq-ack-mode.adoc[Acknowledge a Message].
+
image::mq-message-delete-trash-can-icon2.png[]

Now you are able to send and receive messages in Anypoint MQ. In the next section, you can try
alternate ways of formatting messages.

== Send a CSV or JSON Message

. Click *Message Sender*.
. Set the *Type* to *JSON*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
"animal that walks":"dog",
"animal that swims":"fish",
"animal that flies":"parrot"
}
----
+
. Click *Message Browser* and the message ID to view the message:
+
image::mq-json-get-msg2.png[]

To send a CSV message:

. Click *Message Sender*.
. Set the *Type* to *CSV*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
----
"dog",
"fish",
"parrot"
----
+
. Click Message Browser and the message ID to view the message.

== Register a Client Application

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click *MQ*.
. Click *Client App*:
+
image::mq-click-client-apps.png[]
+
. Click the blue plus icon image:mq-blue-plus-icon.png[].
. Specify an application name such as `DemoClientApp` and click *Save Changes*.
+
image::mq-create-client-app-name.png[]
+
. Leave the *Client Apps* window open as you need to copy and
paste the client ID and client secret
into the configuration for Anypoint Studio.

== Configure Anypoint MQ in Design Center

IMPORTANT: Disable password programs such as LastPass or Okta in your browser before using Design Center. Otherwise, the password program inserts passwords in the HTTP Listener's TLS tab. The passwords in the TLS tab cause the app to fail. 

Before starting to configure an application in Design Center, leave a browser window open to *Anypoint 
Platform* > *MQ*. Determine the queue you want to access and have a client application available so you can copy its client ID and secret.

. In *Anypoint Platform* > *Design Center*, click *Create* > *Mule Application*:
+
image::mq-dc-create.png[]
+
. Provide a project name and click *Create*. In this tutorial, the app is called `mqdemo`:
+
image::mq-dc-new-mule-app.png[]
+
. In the help wizard, click *Go straight to Canvas*.
+
image::mq-dc-go-straight.png[]
+
. Select a trigger for the action that starts Anypoint MQ connector access. The 
simplest trigger is HTTP Listener, which we use in this tutorial to initiate access using a `curl` command. Alternatively you can use Anypoint MQ as a subscriber to retrieve messages from a destination name, or specify a scheduler to accept input at prescribed times.
+
Type in a few letters in the trigger search box, such as "HT" and select the HTTP Listener:
+
image::mq-dc-http-find.png[]
+
. In the HTTP Listener, set the *Path* to the `/mq/{messageId}` value.
+
image::mq-dc-http-path.png[]
+
. Click the plus symbol to the right of the trigger:
+
image::mq-dc-click-plus.png[]
+
. In the *Component* menu, select the Mule Anypoint MQ Connector.
. For this tutorial, select the *Publish* operation:
+
image::mq-dc-publish-op.png[]
+
For the other operations, if you were constructing your application to receive a message sent from a queue, you would use the *Consume* operation. If your application had tests to determine if message processing succeeded, you would use the *Ack* operation  
to acknowledge that a message was received and could be deleted. Similarly if message 
processing failed, you would use the *Nack* operation to negatively acknowledge the message. In the case of *Nack*, the message would be returned to the queue to await accessing.
+ 
. In the *Destination*, specify the name of queue you want to access from your *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* browser window, such as `MyDemoQueue` that was created earlier in this tutorial. Then click
*Set Up*.
+
image::mq-dc-destination.png[]
+
. Copy the client ID and client secret from your *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* browser window. In the *MQ* 
window, click *Client Apps* and click the name of an application. Click *Copy* for each ID and 
secret values and paste each in the Design Center window.
+
image::mq-dc-client-id-secret.png[]
+
. Click *Test* to ensure that you have access to your Anypoint MQ app. If successful,
the green *Test Successful* box appears. If not, ensure that the client ID, client secret,
and URL values are correct. If the URL does not match that in *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ*, copy
the URL from Anypoint MQ to the Design Center screen and click *Test* again.
+
image::mq-dc-test-connection.png[]
+
. Click the *Run* button. 
+
image::mq-dc-run-btn.png[]
+
image::mq-dc-running.png[]

=== Test Your Design Center App

. Run this command from a command prompt to send the `body` value as an Anypoint MQ message. The `100` value in the URL 
specifies the message ID value per the `/mq{messageId}` value in the HTTP Listener, which is the identifier for your message:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://DEPLOYMENT_URL/mq/100 \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '[  {   
    "body": "Welcome to MuleSoft!"
  }
]'
----
+
You can find the value for `DEPLOYMENT_URL` in the detail for your application in Design Center window:
+
image::mq-dc-details.png[]
+
. In *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ*, click the name of the queue you specified as the Destination in Design Center. Click *Message Browser*:
+
image::mq-msg-browser.png[]
+
. Click *Get Messages*:
+
image::mq-get-messages.png[]
+
. Click the *ID* value in the message page to view the message contents:
+
image::mp-dc-test-in-mq.png[]
+
. Try changing the body text in the `curl` command and repeating the steps to view the message.

You can now configure Anypoint MQ in Design Center, submit REST API commands to the MQ Broker API, 
and use Anypoint MQ to view the results.


== Create a Studio 7 Application

You can use Anypoint Studio 7 to create an Anypoint MQ application much the same way as you
created in Design Center. Studio 7 enables you to create the application, 
you can test the program, and then package the application into a zip file to 
put into *Anypoint Platform* > *Runtime Manager*. Runtime Manager serves the application so
you can submit `curl` commands as you did in the previous <<Configure Anypoint MQ in Design Center>> section. See xref:mq-connectors.adoc[MQ Connectors] for more information.

Prerequisites: 

* Studio 7 requires that you install https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle Java SDK 8]. Earlier versions of Java or versions after version 8 are not supported. 
* In Anypoint Platform, change the environment to *Production* and ensure that any 
values you set and get in *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* are also in the Production environment.
* If you have not done so already, https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/studio[download and install Anypoint Studio 7].

=== Configure Studio 7 for Anypoint MQ

. Start Studio, click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*, and give the the project a name such as `mq`.
. Click the Exchange icon in the toolbar:
+
image::mq-st7-exchange.png[]
+
. In Exchange, click Login and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. Search for the Anypoint MQ Connector, click *Add to project*, and click *Proceed*.
. Click HTTP in the Mule Palette:
+
image::mq-st7-mule-palette.png[]
+
. Click *Listener* and drag it to the Studio canvas.
. Click Anypoint MQ and drag *Publish* to the right of the Listener on the canvas:
+
image::mq-st7-flow.png[]
+
. Click the Listener icon. Set *General* > *Path* to `/mq/{messageId}`:
+
image::mq-st7-listener-path.png[]
+
. Click the green plus button to the right of the *Connector configuration* field.
. Set *Host* to `0.0.0.0` and *Port* to `8081`. Leave all other values as they are:
+
image::mq-st7-globals.png[]
+
. Click the MQ Publish icon. Set *Destination* to the name of a queue in *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ*. Ensure that the queue is in the Production environment.
. Click the green plus button to the right of the *Connector configuration* field.
. Set the URL field to the URL in *MQ*:
+
image::mq-url.png[]
+
. In *MQ*, click *Client Apps*. If needed, create a new app. Copy the client ID and client secret to the clipboard and paste each into Studio. Ensure that *MQ* displays the Production environment.
+
image::mq-st7-id-secret.png[]
+
. Click *Test Connection* to ensure the values are correct.
. Save your project. Right click the name of your app in Package Explorer and click
*Anypoint Platform* > *Deploy to CloudHub*.
+
image::mq-st7-deploy.png[]
+
If you see this message: `You do not have permission to deploy new applications in this environment. Please select an existing application to redeploy`, change the environment so that it is *not* the Design environment. For example, set the environment to Production or Sandbox.
To change the environment, click *Design* in the upper left corner, and select another environment.
+
You may also need to change the name of the application to deploy it successfully.
+
. Browse to *Anypoint Platform* > *Runtime Manager*. Ensure the application is running. Click
the application and copy the *App url* value:
+
image::mq-app-url.png[]
+
. In the following command, replace `DEPLOYMENT_URL` with the *App url* value from Runtime Manager. Run this command from a command prompt to send the "body" value as an Anypoint MQ message. 
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
curl -X POST \
  http://DEPLOYMENT_URL/mq/100 \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '[  {   
    "body": "Message via Runtime Manager"
  }
]'
----
+
If you see a 404 message for destination not found, verify that the name of the queue 
in the Studio 7 *MQ Publish* > *Destination* field matches the name of the queue in *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ*.
+
You can redeploy your application by right-clicking the project in Studio 7 and 
selecting *Anypoint Platform* > *Deploy to CloudHub*. This command lets you update the
app in Runtime Manager.
+
. In *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ* (in the Production environment), click the queue name, click
Message Browser, Get Messages, and click the message to view the content of the message:
+

== Create a Message Exchange

A message exchange groups one or more queues so that a message sent to the message exchange goes to all bound queues.

. Log into *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the blue plus icon image:mq-blue-plus-icon.png[]
. Click *Exchange*.
. Specify the name `MyDemoExchange`.
. Click the checkbox to bind `MyDemoQueue` to this message exchange.
. Click *Save Changes*.
. In the *Destinations* screen, click the message exchange *Type* to list its details.

To delete a message exchange, see xref:mq-faq.adoc#how-do-i-delete-an-exchange[How do I delete a Message Exchange?] in the xref:mq-faq.adoc[Anypoint MQ FAQ].

== Bind a Queue to a Message Exchange

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the left side of the message exchange entry in *Destinations*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Where you click on a message exchange entry, the *Destinations* table governs
what you see next:

image:mq-where-to-click-x2.png[]
====
+
. In the message exchange menu, click *Bind* for each queue you want to bind to the message exchange:
+
image::mq-bind-queue-to-exchange2.png[]

== Send a Message to a Message Exchange

Sending a message to a message exchange is very similar to sending a message to a queue.
The only difference is that you can get the message from any queue bound to a message exchange.

. Log into *Anypoint Platform* > *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the `MessageExchange` entry in *Destinations* to view details about
the message exchange.
. Click the *MessageExchange* link in the details screen to access the *Message Sender*:
+
image::mq-exchange-msg-access2.png[]
+
. Click *Message Sender*:
+
image::mq-exchange-msg-sender2.png[]
+
. Type the contents of the *Payload* and click *Send*:
+
image::mq-exchange-payload2.png[]

You can now use the *Message Browser* to get the message from `MyDemoQueue` as described
in <<Get a Message From a Queue>>.

You can also send comma-separated value (CSV) or JSON content in the payload by changing
the message Type value. For more information, see <<Send a CSV or JSON Message>>.
